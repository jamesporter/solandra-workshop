## Solving Sol with Solandra Challenge

1. Wall Drawing #16 (1969) Bands of lines 12 inches (30 cm) wide, in three directions (vertical, horizontal, diagonal right) intersecting.
2. Wall Drawing #17 (1969) Four-part drawing with a different line direction in each part.
3. Wall Drawing #91 (1971) A six-inch (15 cm) grid covering the wall. Within each square, not straight lines from side to side, using red, yellow and blue pencils. Each square contains at least one line of each color.
4. Wall Drawing #797 (1995) The first drafter has a black marker and makes an irregular horizontal line near the top of the wall. Then the second drafter tries to copy it (without touching it) using a red marker. The third drafter does the same, using a yellow marker. The fourth drafter does the same using a blue marker. Then the second drafter followed by the third and fourth copies the last line drawn until the bottom of the wall is reached.
